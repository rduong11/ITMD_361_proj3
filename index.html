    <p>Hello, my name is Raymond Duong and I'm a 4th year CS major. </p>

    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
    <p>I was born in raised here in Chicago! If you aren't from here, Chicago is a very neighborhood centered city.</p>
    <p>My house is located in the West Ridge area, but I'm also bordered by Edgewater, Andersonville, and Rogers Park (more well-known neighborhoods).</p>
    <p>Though I lived in this area, I primarily grew up in a neighborhood called Uptown, but I know it as Argyle.</p>

    <h3>Argyle</h3>
    <p>Argyle is a densely Vietnamese populated neighborhood.</p>
    <p>From Broadway and Foster to Broadway and Ainslie, you will find a tightknit Vietnamese community, fostering:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Predominantly Vietnamese restaurants catering authentic and delicious food (most of the others are other Asian restaurants such as Chinese or Thai)</li>
      <li>Stores that sell Vietnamese niche things, such as nail polish (Most Vietnamese immigrants are nail technicians), spices, and pottery</li>
      <li>Vietnamese grocery markets that sell not just Vietnamese groceries but a lot of Asian/exotic groceries</li>
      <li>Healthcare infrastructure that has Vietnamese-English speaking workers</li>
      <li>Lots of boba restaurants/cafes; boba or bubble tea is a sweet drink that combines tea with milk and boba, which is basically tapioca pearls</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Besides being surrounded by this community, I actually went to elementary school a couple blocks from here too.</p>
    <p>From Pre-K through 8th grade, my parents enrolled me in a Catholic private school called St. Thomas of Canterbury.</p>
    <p>Often times after school I would go to a summer camp called Vietnamese Association of Illinois, or go to my grandma's house a couple blocks down.</p>
    <p>It's a little ironic that they enrolled me in this school, because my family practices Buddhism.</p>
    <p>The story behind me going here is that they believed that a private school would have a more prestigious education/curriculum.</p>
    <p>Though this was true, since it was a small private school, we lacked the resources that public schools had that were funded from the government directly.</p>
    <p>I still remember using hand-me-down textbooks that were falling off their binder, and our school not being able to afford Chromebooks until I was around 5th or 6th grade... good times!</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, to this day I am still so grateful for my parents and the sacrifices they've made for me to have a prosperous future.</p>
    <p>So far, I think I'm doing good! It is my lifelong dream to be able to retire them and let them live comfortably. I am getting closer and closer to this goal as time goes on :]</p>

    <h2>High School</h2>
    <p>Skipping next in the education timeline, I attended a high school called Lane Tech College Prep.</p>
    <p>High school was a pretty pivotal point in my life, allowing me to grow out of my shell and prosper socially and academically.</p>
    <p>I didn't do many extracurriculars here, because I devoted most of my time to one club: Chinese Club.</p>

    <h3>Chinese Club</h3>
    <p>At my school, there were a lot of clubs, but by far the most populated were the ethnic clubs.</p>
    <p>Every year around mid-March, Lane hosts an event called International Days/Nights.</p>
    <p>It consists of all the ethnic clubs coming together to perform a choreographed ethnic dance that represents their culture.</p>
    <div id="center">

    </div>
    <p>Typically, clubs will start their tryouts for new members around October.</p>
    <p>From this time until March, they will come up with choreography and practice, with practices ranging up to 1 hour to 3 hours depending on the proximity of the performance date.</p>
    <p>It was at this school that I developed a passion for CS. We were fortunate enough to have lots of resources and amazing teachers for this career path.</p>

    <h2>Present</h2>
    <p>Now I am studying CS at IIT (wow surprise!)</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, I have not landed any internships, but hopefully soon (I better because I'm about to graduate).</p>
    <p>Post-grad, I am very interested in front-end development or maybe game development.</p>
